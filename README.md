## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

```bash
# Install uv package manager (if not already installed)
brew install uv

# Clone and install dependencies
git clone git@github.com:OmerBS123/agents-league.git
cd distributed-ai-agent-league
uv sync --all-groups
```

### Minimal Example

**Start the entire league system:**
```bash
./start_league.sh
```

**What this does:**
1. ✅ **Installs** all dependencies using uv
2. ✅ **Starts** League Manager (port 8000) - central coordinator
3. ✅ **Starts** Referee (port 8001) - match orchestrator
4. ✅ **Starts** 4 Player agents (ports 8101-8104) with different strategies
5. ✅ **Registers** all players with the League Manager
6. ✅ **Begins** automated round-robin tournament
7. ✅ **Monitors** all processes and handles graceful shutdown on Ctrl+C

### Common Usage Patterns

**Monitor tournament status:**
```bash
# Get current tournament status
curl http://localhost:8000/tournament/status

# View live standings
curl http://localhost:8000/tournament/standings

# Check agent health
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8001/health
curl http://localhost:8101/health
```

**Start individual agents manually:**
```bash
# Start League Manager only
uv run python -m agents.league_manager

# Start a single player with specific strategy
uv run python -m agents.player --port 8101 --strategy random --agent-id player:P01

# Start Referee
uv run python -m agents.referee
```

**Run integration tests:**
```bash
uv run pytest test_integration.py -v
```

### Output

**When running start_league.sh, you'll see:**

## Documentation

### How It Works

The system implements a distributed tournament using a three-tier architecture:

1. **Agent Registration** - Players register with League Manager, providing their contact endpoint and supported strategies
2. **Tournament Initialization** - League Manager generates round-robin schedule and sends match assignments to Referee
3. **Match Execution** - Referee orchestrates matches by sending game invitations and move requests to players
4. **Move Decision** - Players use their strategy (random, history-based, or LLM) to choose even/odd within 2-second timeout
5. **Result Aggregation** - Referee reports match results to League Manager, which updates standings in real-time

**Game Rules (Even/Odd Parity):**
1. Referee generates a random number between 1-10
2. Both players independently choose "even" or "odd" within 2 seconds
3. Players whose choice matches the number's parity win the round
4. Match consists of 10 rounds; player with most wins takes the match
5. Timeouts or errors count as round losses

**Communication Protocol:**

All inter-agent messages use the MCP (Message Communication Protocol) envelope format:

```python
{
  "protocol_version": "league.v2",
  "message_type": "CHOOSE_PARITY",
  "message_id": "uuid-here",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-24T12:00:00Z",
  "sender": "referee:main",
  "data": {
    "match_id": "uuid-here",
    "round_number": 1,
    "timeout_ms": 2000
  }
}
```

### Usage Examples

**Example 1: Start full system and monitor**
```bash
# Start all agents
./start_league.sh

# In another terminal, monitor tournament
curl http://localhost:8000/tournament/standings | jq '.'

# Example output:
# {
#   "standings": [
#     {
#       "agent_id": "player:P01",
#       "wins": 5,
#       "losses": 1,
#       "rank": 1
#     },
#     ...
#   ],
#   "matches_completed": 6,
#   "matches_total": 12
# }
```

**Example 2: Start agents individually**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start League Manager
uv run python -m agents.league_manager

# Terminal 2: Start Referee
uv run python -m agents.referee

# Terminal 3-6: Start Players with different strategies
uv run python -m agents.player --port 8101 --strategy random --agent-id player:P01
uv run python -m agents.player --port 8102 --strategy history --agent-id player:P02
uv run python -m agents.player --port 8103 --strategy llm --agent-id player:P03
uv run python -m agents.player --port 8104 --strategy random --agent-id player:P04
```

**Example 3: Test individual components**
```bash
# Test schema validation
uv run python test_integration.py

# Test League Manager health
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# Send manual registration (for testing)
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "protocol_version": "league.v2",
    "message_type": "LEAGUE_REGISTER_REQUEST",
    "message_id": "'$(uuidgen)'",
    "timestamp": "'$(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)'",
    "sender": "player:TEST",
    "data": {
      "display_name": "Test Player",
      "contact_endpoint": "http://localhost:9999",
      "strategies": ["random"]
    }
  }'
```

### Player Strategies

**Random Strategy:**
- Randomly selects "even" or "odd" each round
- No memory of previous rounds
- Fast decision time (~1ms)
- Baseline strategy for comparison

**History Strategy:**
- Analyzes opponent's previous choices
- Predicts opponent's next move based on patterns
- Adapts to opponent behavior over multiple rounds
- More effective against predictable opponents

**LLM Strategy:**
- Uses Ollama-hosted language model (e.g., llama3)
- Receives game context and opponent history as prompt
- Generates strategic decision with reasoning
- Requires Ollama service running locally
- Decision time ~500ms-1500ms (within 2s timeout)

### Message Types

The system uses several message types for agent communication:

| Message Type | Direction | Purpose |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| `LEAGUE_REGISTER_REQUEST` | Player → Manager | Register agent with league |
| `LEAGUE_REGISTER_RESPONSE` | Manager → Player | Acknowledge registration |
| `GAME_INVITATION` | Referee → Player | Invite player to match |
| `GAME_JOIN_ACK` | Player → Referee | Accept invitation |
| `CHOOSE_PARITY` | Referee → Player | Request move (even/odd) |
| `CHOOSE_PARITY_RESPONSE` | Player → Referee | Submit move choice |
| `GAME_OVER` | Referee → Player | Notify match completion |
| `MATCH_RESULT_REPORT` | Referee → Manager | Report match outcome |
| `STANDINGS_UPDATE` | Manager → All | Broadcast updated standings |

### Requirements

- **Python 3.13 or higher** - Required for modern async features and type hints
- **Network connectivity** - Agents communicate via HTTP on localhost
- **Available ports** - System requires ports 8000-8001 and 8101-8104 to be free
- **Memory** - Minimum 512MB RAM, recommended 1GB+ for LLM strategy
- **CPU** - Any modern CPU sufficient; LLM strategy benefits from faster processors
- **Ollama** (optional) - Required only for LLM strategy; must be running locally

### Validation Commands

Test your installation with these commands:

```bash
# Verify Python version
python --version  # Should be 3.13+

# Verify uv installation
uv --version

# Verify dependencies installed correctly
uv run python -c "import fastapi, pydantic, httpx; print('✅ All core imports OK')"

# Run integration tests
uv run pytest test_integration.py -v

# Start system and check health
./start_league.sh

# In another terminal:
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # Should return {"status": "healthy"}
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Should return {"status": "healthy"}
curl http://localhost:8101/health  # Should return {"status": "healthy"}

# Check tournament status
curl http://localhost:8000/tournament/status

# View standings
curl http://localhost:8000/tournament/standings
```

### Troubleshooting

**Problem: "Port already in use" error**
```bash
# Find and kill processes using required ports
lsof -i :8000
lsof -i :8001
lsof -i :8101-8104

# Kill specific process
kill -9 <PID>

# Or use the cleanup in start_league.sh (Ctrl+C gracefully stops all agents)
```

**Problem: "Connection refused" between agents**
```bash
# Verify all agents are running
curl http://localhost:8000/health
curl http://localhost:8001/health
curl http://localhost:8101/health

# Check startup logs for errors
./start_league.sh  # Look for error messages in red

# Verify no firewall blocking localhost communication
```

**Problem: LLM strategy timing out**
```bash
# Verify Ollama is running
curl http://localhost:11434/api/tags

# Start Ollama if not running
ollama serve

# Check model is downloaded
ollama list

# Pull model if missing
ollama pull llama3

# Test Ollama directly
curl http://localhost:11434/api/generate -d '{
  "model": "llama3",
  "prompt": "Hello",
  "stream": false
}'
```

**Problem: "Module not found" errors**
```bash
# Reinstall all dependencies
uv sync --all-groups

# Verify virtual environment is activated
uv run python -c "import sys; print(sys.prefix)"

# Check if packages are installed
uv pip list
```

**Problem: Tests failing**
```bash
# Run with verbose output to see details
uv run pytest test_integration.py -v -s

# Run specific test function
uv run pytest test_integration.py::test_imports -v

# Clear pytest cache
rm -rf .pytest_cache __pycache__
uv run pytest test_integration.py -v
```
