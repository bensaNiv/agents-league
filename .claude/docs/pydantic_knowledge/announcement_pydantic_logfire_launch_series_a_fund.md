Today, I am excited to announce two significant milestones for our company:
**First,[Pydantic Logfire — our developer-centric observability platform](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) — is leaving beta** and is ready for use by all developers and organizations. **Secondly, we have raised $12.5 million in Series A funding** , led by 
**Update:** TechCrunch have covered the announcement 
_I've written a longer post about why we decided to build Pydantic Logfire[here](https://pydantic.dev/articles/why-logfire), and why we think we are the right team to do so._
Over the course of our beta, Pydantic Logfire has seen significant growth and adoption. This momentum has not only validated our vision for a developer-centric observability platform, but also given our investors the confidence to deepen their commitment.
With this additional funding, we are committed to accelerating the development of Pydantic Logfire, introducing new features, and ensuring that our platform can handle loads of any scale. If you've been waiting to adopt Pydantic Logfire, you can now start to integrate it into your workflows with confidence.
We offer a generous free tier and a simple, scalable [pay-as-you-go pricing model](https://pydantic.dev/pricing). _If you've been using Pydantic Logfire in beta, thank you. Beta users who missed our offer of credit, please feel free to[get in touch](https://pydantic.dev/contact) and we'll extend the offer to you._
While we are excited to leave beta, Pydantic Logfire is still in rapid development. In particular, we still consider our alerts functionality "in beta", and we expect significant improvements in the near future.
We wouldn't be where we are today without the support of our investors, and I'm thrilled to continue our partnership with them going forward.
