We're launching Py AI, a series of events bringing together people building with Python and AI. Each event features lightning talks, live demos, and networking. The kind of conversations that happen when practitioners get together.

**Who should attend?**
Python developers building with AI frameworks, working on agentic systems, or integrating LLMs into production applications. If you're working with tools like Pydantic, MCP, LangChain, or distributed compute infrastructure, these events are for you.
**What's the format?**
Each event (except the conference) runs for around 2 to 3 hours with 4 or 5 lightning talks (10-15 minutes each), followed by open networking. Talks will focus on practical implementation details, not high-level theory.
**Do I need to prepare anything?**
No preparation required. Bring questions about your current projects if you want specific feedback during networking sessions.
**Is there a cost?**
All events are free. Registration is required due to venue capacity.

Events will not be recorded and attendance is in-person only.
