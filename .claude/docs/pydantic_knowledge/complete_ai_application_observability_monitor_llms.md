Visualise your whole app, not just LLM calls
Pydantic Logfire shows your complete application, AI to API. Observe LLM calls, agent reasoning, API latency, database queries, vector searches, and everything in between. Real AI applications are complex systems, and problems often hide in the seams between components. Get full visibility across your entire stack, catch issues before production, and understand the complete picture from local development to production monitoring.
### Complete AI Application Observability
Discover how Logfire provides end-to-end observability for AI applications—from LLM calls and agent reasoning to your entire application stack.

INTRODUCING LOGFIRE
## A more intuitive way to understand your
LLM
Pydantic Logfire is a window into the inner workings of your application. Smooth to set up and easy to understand, with ready integrations for many popular libraries.

Insights
### Query your data with full SQL
Query your data with full Postgres flavored SQL — all the control and (for many) nothing new to learn. Even if you don’t like writing SQL, LLMs do, so SQL plus an MCP server lets your IDE use Pydantic Logfire as a window into your app’s execution. Search for obstacles and opportunities, as you (or the AI) writes code.
![diagram showing an IDE using MCP server to query Logfire data](https://pydantic.dev/cdn-cgi/image/width=3840,quality=75,format=auto/https://pydantic.dev/assets/logfire/query-data.png)
## From local to prod
See your application traces appear in real time. Spin up Pydantic Logfire in your local development environment and carry it through your entire dev-lifecycle, from initial debugging to production monitoring. The same observability platform that helps you catch bugs as you code keeps your production systems healthy too. No tool switching, no context loss, no friction.
## Built on open standards, usable in 3-10 LOC
Pydantic Logfire is built on , which you’d expect for a modern observability tool. What you might not expect is how verbose it can be to work directly with OTel’s SDKs, compared to our custom streamlined and ergonomic SDKs for Python, Rust and Typescript. Plus, our SDKs make the live view more powerful, like rendering spans before they’ve completed.
```
import logfire

logfire.configure()

logfire.info('Hello, {name}!', name='world')

```

## Visibility is more than classic Observability
Beyond devops and responding to incidents, for quality over time you also want integrated analytics. You should be able to use the same view to see exceptions and why a customer downgraded. Or see a chart of payment volume in the same dashboard that shows you a chart of API response times. Pydantic Logfire is flexible and powerful enough to do both so you can understand your code and visualise its impact. For AI applications specifically, [explore our AI observability capabilities](https://pydantic.dev/logfire/ai-observability).
## Integrates with the tools you love
Get a robust, consistent view into your application, regardless of your stack.

## Logfire is already making developers' lives easier
It's just that amazingly simple and helpful. Logfire will change the way Python people do application level observability for sure.
Florian Kromer
Logfire is a fantastic tool for us; all developers should use it. We have a small dev team and Logfire has already led to us catching and solving issues in a way we couldn't before. The easy integration with Django and our other Python services made implementation very simple; our junior developers love it.
Tom Hamilton Stubber
Logfire was super easy to setup, but gave us superpowers in terms of the insights we got instantly for our API. Combining logs, profiling and telemetry all in one. Seriously, it's just what we needed and really love it.
Birk Jernström
Logfire is the observability platform built by the stellar team behind Pydantic, if you use FastAPI or Pydantic in general, you should definitely check it out!
Sebastián Ramírez
It was extremely easy! It took all of 10 minutes to get it running in our test suite and local dev env.
Peter Hoburg
I’m blown away by Logfire. It’s the observability and monitoring tooling of my dreams. Extremely simple, clean, and intuitive. Python just got its best upgrade since Pydantic.
