# About Pydantic - Our Mission, Team & Story

## Driven by curiosity, frustration and coffee
I started working on Pydantic out of a mixture of frustration that type hints do nothing at runtime and curiosity as to whether they could be used to validate data.
Turns out I was right (or lucky) and with Pydantic's crazy growth, the maintainers behind it now get to build other products with the same principles — that the most powerful tools can still be easy to use.
