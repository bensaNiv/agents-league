##  [#](https://pydantic.dev/jobs/solutions-engineer#the-opportunity)The Opportunity
We are looking for a **Solutions Engineer** , ideally someone with a software engineering background to take ownership of our post-sales success. You will be the technical bridge between our customers (CTOs and Lead Engineers) and our [Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire) product.
This is a deeply technical, customer-facing role. You will work directly with the VP of Sales to make Pydantic Logfire "sticky" and unblock revenue growth.
This role might appeal to a technical person who is tired of the ticket grind but loves the technology and wants to move into the business & sales side of a high-growth company, or someone already in a sales engineering/devrel type of role. If you are interested in/familiar with AI engineering best practices that is a big plus.
##  [#](https://pydantic.dev/jobs/solutions-engineer#mission-why-this-role-exists)Mission: Why this role exists
Your goal is to make Pydantic Logfire indispensable. You will ensure customers achieve their observability goals, identify opportunities to grow their usage (upsell), and build the processes that allow us to scale our enterprise offering without a dip in customer experience.
**1. Prevent Churn**
  * Keep Logfire high-value customers happy. This includes onboarding, but also ongoing training, demoing new features and maintaining the relationship. You will be the "early warning system." You will set up alerts and monitor telemetry to detect customer issues (e.g., rate limits or integration errors) _before_ the customer complains.


**2. Upsell & Cross-sell**
  * You will identify accounts ready for Enterprise plans by analyzing their usage data.
  * You will spot opportunities to cross-sell Pydantic Gateway to existing Logfire users.


**3. Funnel Customer Insights**
  * You are the eyes and ears on the ground. You will funnel rich, technical customer insights back to the engineering team to inform product decisions.


**4. Unblock Deals & Engineer Operations**
  * **The Grit (Get It Done):** You must be willing to roll up your sleeves and own the unglamorous work—filling out security questionnaires and vendor assessments—to get revenue across the line.
  * **The Fix (Automate It):** You view manual repetition as a bug. You will apply your engineering aptitude to this problem, building the knowledge base and implementing the tooling to automate these reviews, turning a manual drag into a swift, repeatable formality.


##  [#](https://pydantic.dev/jobs/solutions-engineer#who-you-are)Who You Are
  * **Software Engineer/AI Engineer/SRE:** You have production coding experience (ideally Python). You know what a stack trace is, you understand async/await, and you can debug a customer's OTel instrumentation on a Zoom call.
  * **Good with Customers:** You like talking to devs and helping them solve their problems. They like you back.
  * **Process-Oriented:** You are willing to help document the sales playbook. You don't need a RevOps team to tell you how to organize a CRM or follow up on a late payment (or feel confident you can figure it out).
  * **Resilient & Autonomous:** We are a lean team (~20 people). You must be able to operate without a massive support structure.
  * **Operational Mindset:** You understand that "getting stuck in" is part of the job. You are humble enough to fill out a security spreadsheet to close a deal, but smart enough to build a system so you never have to do it manually again.


##  [#](https://pydantic.dev/jobs/solutions-engineer#non-technical-requirements)Non-technical Requirements
  1. **Required:** Live and work in a timezone between PT (UTC-8) and CET (UTC+1). **This is a hard requirement.**
  2. **Required:** Able to travel to EU, UK and US up to 4 times a year to join our off-sites.
  3. **Required:** Fluent in English.


##  [#](https://pydantic.dev/jobs/solutions-engineer#about-us)About Us
Pydantic Validation is the data validation library that powers modern Python development - 300 million downloads per month, used by virtually every tech company you've heard of. Why? Because we obsess over developer experience and write code we'd actually want to use ourselves.
We're applying that same engineering mindset to [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire), our observability platform built for today's development reality: AI workloads, multi-language environments, and cloud infrastructure that's designed to be straightforward to set up and maintain.
We build with technologies developers actually want to work with:
  * OpenTelemetry for standardized instrumentation
  * SQL for intuitive querying (no proprietary query language to learn)
  * Rust, Python, and TypeScript for performance and productivity
  * Postgres, DataFusion, and object storage for scalable backends


Unlike other companies that pay lip service to open source, we commit over 20% of our engineering team to maintaining and expanding our [open source ecosystem](https://pydantic.dev/opensource). This includes the core Pydantic Validation library and [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) - our rapidly growing framework that's becoming the standard for AI application development. We're signatories of the open source pledge and build on open standards because we believe in interoperability, not lock-in. Use our OpenTelemetry-based SDK with any compatible backend - we're confident you'll choose us on merit.
We're backed by 
Join our team of exceptional engineers who value substance over hype, practical approaches over perfectionism, and meaningful progress over busyness. We've built a culture that balances technical ambition with sustainable practices—minimal meetings and respect for your expertise and time. We're creating tools that genuinely improve developers' lives, and we're looking for thoughtful contributors who share our commitment to quality and our passion for elegant solutions.
