# AI Observability Platform | Monitor LLMs, Agents & AI Applications | Pydantic Logfire

AI Observability
# Complete observability for modern LLM applications
Pydantic Logfire monitors your **complete AI application** , including LLM calls, agent reasoning, API latency, database queries, vector searches, and everything in between. Built on OpenTelemetry with **first-class support for AI & general observability** and native integrations for AI frameworks.
[Get started Get started](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/)[Documentation](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs)
The Full Picture
## Real AI applications are complex systems
Problems in production AI applications rarely come from the LLM alone. They hide in the seams: slow database queries that delay context retrieval, API timeouts during agent tool calls, inefficient vector searches, or memory leaks in background tasks. You need visibility across your **entire application stack** , not just the LLM calls.
### What Logfire shows you
  * ✓**Complete application traces** from request to response
  * ✓**Database** queries, **API** calls, and business logic
  * ✓**Dashboards** and application **metrics**
  * ✓**One platform** with **first-class AI & general observability** for your entire application


### What others show you
  * ✗LLM request/response only
  * ✗Missing context on performance bottlenecks
  * ✗No visibility into retrieval quality
  * ✗Separate tools for app monitoring


Example
## Monitor RAG pipelines end-to-end
See every stage of your retrieval-augmented generation workflow: from vector search to context building to final generation. Identify bottlenecks and optimize performance.

## Why Logfire for AI Observability?
### OpenTelemetry-Native
Built on industry-standard OpenTelemetry. No vendor lock-in, export to any backend, or use our hosted platform.
### Complete Application Traces
See your entire application: LLM calls, agent reasoning, database queries, API requests, vector searches, business logic, JS/TS frontend.
### Integrated Evaluation Framework
Use [Pydantic Evals](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/guides/web-ui/evals/?utm_source=website) to continuously evaluate LLM outputs in production. Curate datasets from production traces and catch regressions before users do.
### Real-Time Cost Tracking
Track [LLM API costs](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/guides/web-ui/llm-panels/#understand-token-cost-badges?utm_source=website) in real-time. Identify expensive prompts, optimize model selection, and set budget alerts. See exactly where your AI spending goes.
### Pydantic AI & AI Gateway Integration
Seamlessly integrates with [Pydantic AI](https://pydantic.dev/ai-gateway) for monitoring and [Pydantic AI Gateway](https://pydantic.dev/ai-gateway) model routing across all major LLM providers.
### From Local Dev to Production
See traces in real-time as you code. Catch bugs in development, carry the same observability through to production. No tool switching, no friction.
Integrations
## Works with your entire stack
One-line instrumentation for many frameworks, databases, AI providers, event streams, etc. Auto-instrumentation means you get observability without changing your code.
