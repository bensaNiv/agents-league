Integrations that run on the Datadog Agent use Pydantic models that are generated from an OpenAPI spec to validate configuration which has drastically reduced customer confusion and support cases that we have to triage.

If you're not using Python yet, you should. If you're not using Pydantic yet with Python, you should. Pydantic is the data backbone of FastAPI, but even if you don't use FastAPI, Pydantic is extremely useful. There's always data, and handling data with Pydantic is several times more efficient and safer than without it and much more enjoyable.
