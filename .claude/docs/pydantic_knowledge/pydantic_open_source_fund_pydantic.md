Open source is at the core of Pydantic.
As well as developing and maintaining open source libraries, we use and contribute to many open source projects as we build [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire), our observability platform and primary commercial product.
Today, we are reinforcing our commitment to the **Pydantic Open Source Fund** , we invest a minimum of $2,000 USD per developer per year in open source projects and maintainers. With 14 developers in the team, that is currently $30,000 USD per year.
Spending money to maintain your supply chain should not require an initiative and a glossy website, but for too long the open source ecosystem has been taken for granted. We are proud to be part of the movement to change that.
##  [#](https://pydantic.dev/articles/pydantic-oss-fund-2025#our-open-source-dna)Our Open Source DNA
Back in 2017, Pydantic started as a side project. Today, it is downloaded more than TypeScript and used by millions of developers in companies of all sizes around the world.
> "Open source has changed my life by allowing me to start this company and build [Pydantic Logfire](https://logfire.pydantic.dev/docs/), the observability tool I have dreamed of for years." - Samuel Colvin, Pydantic founder and CEO.
##  [#](https://pydantic.dev/articles/pydantic-oss-fund-2025#our-commitment)Our commitment
We want open source support to make financial sense as well as being intellectually rewarding for more developers.
Our ultimate hope is that investing in the open source ecosystem today delivers the stratospheric return that investing in universities did 800 years ago.
In the past year, we spent roughly $250,000 USD in developing, documenting and maintaining Open Source libraries such as

The Pydantic team maintains numerous major open source projects, including **not** included in the list of projects supported by the Pydantic Open Source Fund.
To choose the projects to support, we used the criteria listed below in the following order of priority:
  1. Projects we rely on for both commercial and open source reasons
  2. Projects we rely on for our commercial products
  3. Projects we rely on for our open source libraries


Then, we selected projects based on:
  1. How critical the project is to what we are working on
  2. How in-need the project is of financial support
  3. How impactful our funding will be in improving the project in ways we care about
  4. How aligned the project is with our values


##  [#](https://pydantic.dev/articles/pydantic-oss-fund-2025#projects-we-support)Projects we support
Projects and maintainers we are sponsoring this year:
Total: $30,700 USD, which represents $2,192 per developer for 2025.
To the maintainers and contributors who keep the open source ecosystem thriving: THANK YOU. Your work makes ours possible, and we are honored to support you through this fund.

Mechanical and structural engineering companies have always spent a large proportion of their revenue on their supply chain. Somewhere between 75% and 85% of the cost of goods sold goes to suppliers (according to 
The extraordinary adoption of software over the last few decades has led software engineering companies to assume they can get away without investing in their supply chain.
We disagree with that. We believe software has eaten the world in spite (not because) of the lack of investment in the open source supply chain.
High-profile security incidents are just the most visible evidence of the problem. The bigger and more insidious side effect of the lack of investment is all the projects that have died or never even properly started because those who benefit from open source are so reluctant to pay for it.
You and your company should stop being such tight-fisted bastards and pay the people who have helped you get rich. It might make you even richer. It might also make the world a better place.
