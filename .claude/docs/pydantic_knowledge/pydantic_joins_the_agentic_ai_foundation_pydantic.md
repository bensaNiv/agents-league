The Foundation was co-founded by 
Three projects are already under AAIF governance:
  * **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** — donated by Anthropic, with over 10,000 active servers adopted by ChatGPT, Cursor, Gemini, Microsoft Copilot, and VS Code


These are widely-adopted tools being placed under neutral governance to ensure they remain open and community-driven.
The Linux Foundation is running the show, which matters. They've successfully stewarded Linux, Kubernetes, Node.js, PyTorch, and dozens of other critical open source projects. They know how to maintain vendor neutrality and foster real collaboration.

> "Open source has changed my life by allowing me to start this company and build [Pydantic Logfire](https://pydantic.dev/logfire/), the observability tool I have dreamed of for years." - Samuel Colvin, Pydantic founder and CEO.
Open source is how we've built Pydantic, our Python data validation library, downloaded 500 million times per month. [Pydantic AI](https://ai.pydantic.dev/) our agent framework is open source. We built [Open Source Pledge](https://pydantic.dev/opensource).
AAIF's mission aligns with that: a neutral, open foundation ensuring agentic AI evolves transparently and collaboratively. The fact that companies like Anthropic and OpenAI are donating their key projects to neutral governance proves this model works.

Silver membership gives us access to working groups, technical committees, and community events. We'll participate in initiatives around open source agent frameworks, contribute to standards, and collaborate with other member organizations.
More importantly, it connects us with teams building adjacent infrastructure — model serving, observability, developer tooling. The best infrastructure emerges from collaboration, not competition.
Whether it's OpenTelemetry becoming the standard for observability data, or Pydantic becoming core to Python development, open standards and transparent development win in the long run. That's the approach we're taking with Pydantic AI, and it's the approach AAIF is taking with agentic AI infrastructure.
