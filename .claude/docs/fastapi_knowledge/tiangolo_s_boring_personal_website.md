Hey! I'm 
You are probably looking for my **[open source projects](https://tiangolo.com/projects/)**.
I'm a software developer from Colombia. 🇨🇴
I currently live in Berlin, Germany. 🇩🇪
I created **[FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com)** , **[Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com)** , **[SQLModel](https://sqlmodel.tiangolo.com)** , **[Asyncer](https://asyncer.tiangolo.com)** , and a bunch of other open source tools. 🚀
I have been building APIs and tools for Machine Learning and data systems, in the Americas, the Middle East, and Europe, with different teams and organizations. 🌎
I'm now working full time on my open source projects and the ecosystem. 🤓
