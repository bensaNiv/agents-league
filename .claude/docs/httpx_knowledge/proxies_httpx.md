# Proxies - HTTPX

[ Skip to content ](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/proxies/#http-proxies)
# Proxies
HTTPX supports setting up `proxy` parameter to be passed on client initialization or top-level API functions like `httpx.get(..., proxy=...)`.

## HTTP Proxies
To route all traffic (HTTP and HTTPS) to a proxy located at `http://localhost:8030`, pass the proxy URL to the client...
```
with httpx.Client(proxy="http://localhost:8030") as client:
    ...

```

For more advanced use cases, pass a mounts `dict`. For example, to route HTTP and HTTPS requests to 2 different proxies, respectively located at `http://localhost:8030`, and `http://localhost:8031`, pass a `dict` of proxy URLs:
```
proxy_mounts = {
    "http://": httpx.HTTPTransport(proxy="http://localhost:8030"),
    "https://": httpx.HTTPTransport(proxy="http://localhost:8031"),
}

with httpx.Client(mounts=proxy_mounts) as client:
    ...

```

For detailed information about proxy routing, see the [Routing](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/proxies/#routing) section.
Gotcha
In most cases, the proxy URL for the `https://` key _should_ use the `http://` scheme (that's not a typo!).
This is because HTTP proxying requires initiating a connection with the proxy server. While it's possible that your proxy supports doing it via HTTPS, most proxies only support doing it via HTTP.
For more information, see [FORWARD vs TUNNEL](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/proxies/#forward-vs-tunnel).
## Authentication
Proxy credentials can be passed as the `userinfo` section of the proxy URL. For example:
```
with httpx.Client(proxy="http://username:password@localhost:8030") as client:
    ...

```

## Proxy mechanisms
Note
This section describes **advanced** proxy concepts and functionality.
### FORWARD vs TUNNEL
In general, the flow for making an HTTP request through a proxy is as follows:
  1. The client connects to the proxy (initial connection request).
  2. The proxy transfers data to the server on your behalf.


How exactly step 2/ is performed depends on which of two proxying mechanisms is used:
  * **Forwarding** : the proxy makes the request for you, and sends back the response it obtained from the server.
  * **Tunnelling** : the proxy establishes a TCP connection to the server on your behalf, and the client reuses this connection to send the request and receive the response. This is known as an 


### Troubleshooting proxies
If you encounter issues when setting up proxies, please refer to our [Troubleshooting guide](https://www.python-httpx.org/troubleshooting/#proxies).
## SOCKS
In addition to HTTP proxies, `httpcore` also supports proxies using the SOCKS protocol. This is an optional feature that requires an additional third-party library be installed before use.
You can install SOCKS support using `pip`:
```
$[socks]

```

You can now configure a client to make requests via a proxy using the SOCKS protocol:
```
httpx.Client(proxy='socks5://user:pass@host:port')

```
