# HTTPX

[ Skip to content ](https://www.python-httpx.org/#features)
![HTTPX](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/encode/httpx/master/docs/img/butterfly.png)
#  HTTPX 
* * *
_A next-generation HTTP client for Python._
HTTPX is a fully featured HTTP client for Python 3, which provides sync and async APIs, and support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.
* * *
Install HTTPX using pip:
```
$
```

Now, let's get started:
```
>>> importhttpx
>>> r = httpx.get('https://www.example.org/')
>>> r
<Response [200 OK]>
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'text/html; charset=UTF-8'
>>> r.text
'<!doctype html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Example Domain</title>...'

```

Or, using the command-line client.
```
# The command line client is an optional dependency.
$'httpx[cli]'

```

Which now allows us to use HTTPX directly from the command-line...

Sending a request...

## Features
HTTPX builds on the well-established usability of `requests`, and gives you:
  * A broadly [requests-compatible API](https://www.python-httpx.org/compatibility/).
  * Standard synchronous interface, but with [async support if you need it](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/).
  * HTTP/1.1 [and HTTP/2 support](https://www.python-httpx.org/http2/).
  * Ability to make requests directly to [WSGI applications](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/transports/#wsgi-transport) or [ASGI applications](https://www.python-httpx.org/advanced/transports/#asgi-transport).
  * Strict timeouts everywhere.
  * Fully type annotated.
  * 100% test coverage.


Plus all the standard features of `requests`...
  * International Domains and URLs
  * Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling
  * Sessions with Cookie Persistence
  * Browser-style SSL Verification
  * Basic/Digest Authentication
  * Elegant Key/Value Cookies
  * Automatic Decompression
  * Automatic Content Decoding
  * Unicode Response Bodies
  * Multipart File Uploads
  * HTTP(S) Proxy Support
  * Connection Timeouts
  * Streaming Downloads
  * .netrc Support
  * Chunked Requests


## Documentation
For a run-through of all the basics, head over to the [QuickStart](https://www.python-httpx.org/quickstart/).
For more advanced topics, see the **Advanced** section, the [async support](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/) section, or the [HTTP/2](https://www.python-httpx.org/http2/) section.
The [Developer Interface](https://www.python-httpx.org/api/) provides a comprehensive API reference.
To find out about tools that integrate with HTTPX, see [Third Party Packages](https://www.python-httpx.org/third_party_packages/).
## Dependencies
The HTTPX project relies on these excellent libraries:
  * `httpcore` - The underlying transport implementation for `httpx`.
  * `h11` - HTTP/1.1 support.
  * `certifi` - SSL certificates.
  * `idna` - Internationalized domain name support.
  * `sniffio` - Async library autodetection.


As well as these optional installs:
  * `h2` - HTTP/2 support. _(Optional, with`httpx[http2]`)_
  * `socksio` - SOCKS proxy support. _(Optional, with`httpx[socks]`)_
  * `rich` - Rich terminal support. _(Optional, with`httpx[cli]`)_
  * `click` - Command line client support. _(Optional, with`httpx[cli]`)_
  * `brotli` or `brotlicffi` - Decoding for "brotli" compressed responses. _(Optional, with`httpx[brotli]`)_
  * `zstandard` - Decoding for "zstd" compressed responses. _(Optional, with`httpx[zstd]`)_


A huge amount of credit is due to `requests` for the API layout that much of this work follows, as well as to `urllib3` for plenty of design inspiration around the lower-level networking details.
## Installation
Install with pip:
```
$
```

Or, to include the optional HTTP/2 support, use:
```
$[http2]

```

To include the optional brotli and zstandard decoders support, use:
```
$[brotli,zstd]

```

HTTPX requires Python 3.9+
