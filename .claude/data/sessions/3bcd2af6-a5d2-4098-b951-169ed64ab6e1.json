Start by gathering information: Read the error logs, stack traces, or failing test outputs.\n2.  Locate the relevant file(s) and read the code around the failure.\n3.  Form a hypothesis.\n4.  Create a reproduction script or add detailed logging (using `Edit`) to verify your hypothesis.\n5.  Once the root cause is found, propose the fix or apply it if straightforward.\n6.  Report back to the main user ONLY the solution and the root cause, sparing them the trial-and-error details.\\\n\\\n",
