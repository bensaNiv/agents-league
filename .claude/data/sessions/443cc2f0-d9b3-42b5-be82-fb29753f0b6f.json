    "Add to all of the running commands the following:\\\nuv run --no-sync --offline python \\\nso that it will run on the local one and not the global one \\\nI ment the @.claude/settings.json configurations ",
    "The text to speach call somtimes comes with delay and even after I have heard the answer from the text to speach.\\\ngo over the code of the text to speach in @.claude/hooks/ and tell me what might be the cause of this.\\\n\\\nagain there is a delay when I am running, the task ended I heard a text to speach and then after a second that htere is nothing on the screen I hear another text to speach.\\\n\\\nWe need to understand if the text to speach with the summerry takes time to arrive and therfore creates delay, or maybe we dont need to have a text to seapch and summaarry for every hook.",
    "Lets make the summarry short \\\nhow many messages do we send for the ollama summarry now?",
    "lets test it \\\ncreate in thsi converstaion some dummy stop and lets see that the text to speach runs quick",
    "Now you answered me with \"all done\" and no summarry go over and make sure that the stop and wai for user input are using the hook\\\nalso remove the new test file you created ",
    "I few issues:\\\n1. I dont mind waiting for the summarry a few seconds (10 at most)\\\n2. I dont want to get a random message for the stop and the wait user input always have the summary \n",
    "increase timeout to 30 sec",
    "lets test it have suome summarry generated in this ession and lets se that it works ",
    "why I didnt hear a text to seapch after youre response here?",
    "why cant I hear the text to speach ?",
    "I didnt hear any summarry from the preiveus inpy",
    "I didnt hear any TTS, I restarted my calude coed session so lets try again ",
    "I actually heard it, but when you finished this (meaning ran the stop hook) I didnt hear \\\ncheck the logs and try to figure out why it fails",
    "Ok lets test it and see why the hooks arent activating the text to speach",
    "The concersation ended go over the logs and see what is hte issue ",
    "I didnt hear lets try again with this conversation ",
    "great it works!",
    "This worked but I got two voices\\\n1 when it finished \\\nthe other one a bit more later saying it \"optimized the tts code ...\"\\\ncheck why is that ",
    "great now lets test it create some example for it",
