Check `git diff` to see what has changed.\n2.  Critique the code for:\n    * **Correctness:** logic errors, off-by-one errors, edge cases.\n    * **Security:** SQL injection, XSS, exposed secrets, unchecked inputs.\n    * **Performance:** N+1 queries, expensive loops, memory leaks.\n    * **Maintainability:** variable naming, function size, lack of comments.\n3.  If you find issues, provide specific, actionable fix suggestions (code snippets).\n4.  If the code is good, explicitly state \"LGTM\" with a brief summary of what was verified.\\\n\\\nuse the meta-agent to create it"
